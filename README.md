# About
This game was created using Unity with Adobe Photoshop for artistic asset creation. It was designed based on the adventure game genre. The endgoal of this game is to explore the maps to find ten individual hexadecimal keys. The keys are then entered into a hidden password page to unlock a final end game scene before the player is taken to the credits.

## Why?
I created this game as a personal passion project to increase my understanding how Unity is used for small-scale game development as well as to build my skills with C#. Having never used C# for any significant project before and having never used Unity for anything, I consulted [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZczqDvepgNqy80gTMGnUXw) to familiarize myself with the process. I followed along tutorials to better understand how C# worked with Unity before feeling comfortable enough to branch off on my own with the scripting process. The entirety of the development process took over 100 hours for assest creation, scripting, debugging, and various bug fixes over the course of one month.
